Before we left Brooklyn, I had the good fortune of discovering Maria Popova's writings on life and living on her site [Brain Pickings](https://www.brainpickings.org/), and immediately added it to my ever-adapting list of email newsletters. The breadth and depth to which she takes her readers is really impressive, and maybe it's because I live in tech world, but I find the content refreshing since it provides me a very different but much needed angle on life.

For example, in [this article](https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/12/18/bruce-lee-artist-of-life-self-esteem/) Popova reviews Bruce Lee's writings on self-esteem that reveal a paradox: that those "who are most self-dissatisfied and crave most for a new identity have the least self-awareness", and that lack of self-awareness makes us look to others to tell us who we are.

Thus, a core component of self-improvement is self-awareness. How does one truly know one self?
