Wow, finally learning some Gatsby here. Don't expect to find too much, I'm mostly doing this to bootstrap my learning about building stuff using the latest tools out there. I'm one of the engineers at [AWS Amplify Console](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/console/) team and figured I should try to understand this a little better.

About me: I'm in my mid-thirties so I'm technically a millenial but I feel old, probably because I've changed careers (if you want to call them that) so many times. I love learning and coding though, so I think this software engineering has a good chance of working out. I recently moved to Seattle with my wife (also an aspiring software engineer) from New York, where part of our hearts will forever remain.

I don't have any ideas of what to write about, which is ironic because I love writing and have been talking about how I've been wanting to take up writing for years, so I'll mostly write for myself and do stuff like document what I'm learning through this process. I'm starting with the most basic Gatsby blog starter and will work may way from here.

Some draft principles that will guide my learning path for this exploration:
1. fun/interesting
1. synergize with my work
1. novel over familiar (breadth over depth)
