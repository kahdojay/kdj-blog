description: "Overconfidence vs Underconfidence"
---

I've known for at least fifteen years, but didn't realize that I knew until the last five, that 99% of people really don't know what they're talking about and that the noise is largely a mix of bias, overconfidence, posturing, and ignorance. Once I realized this five or so years ago I became somewhat obsessed with the idea of striking the right level of confidence, since both over- and underconfidence can be costly. The result was that I would err on the side of underconfidence, because overconfident people really bothered me.

I'm starting to think that this isn't the right response because overconfidence, for all its flaws, tends to beat out underconfidence. In poker, smart aggressive play will generally beat out smart passive play. Same with sports. Sales. And so on.

Does this mean that I will start acting like an overconfident jerk? No, because it's not in my nature, but I do think riding that edge between over- and underconfidence while erring on the side of overconfidence is probably the way to go in most cases. (Maybe not if you're a nuclear power plant operator or something like that). It's kind of like Amazon's [Bias for Action principle](https://www.aboutamazon.com/working-at-amazon/our-leadership-principles) but without the need for action or explicit decision making.
