I worked on [isitflatyet.com](https://isitflatyet.org) with my wife, we got to learn a bit about Firebase and some nuances with React and Google Maps API. TBH I've backdated this blog post because life/work is really busy. We also had fun learning about the [Formidable Victory open source charting library](https://formidable.com/open-source/victory/) - highly recommend for simple React data vis. Future project posts will have more meaningful content discussing learnings, I promise.
